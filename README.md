# Final Project: Building a Reactive Web Application

## Project Overview
Create a web application that demonstrates your understanding of state management, reactivity, and component-based architecture. You'll build a CRUD application (minus Update) using the concepts we've covered in class.

## Core Requirements (40 points)

### State Management (15 points)
- Properly implemented state manager using IIFE pattern (5 pts)
- Correct use of closures to maintain private state (5 pts)
- Implementation of necessary state methods (getState, setState, subscribe) (5 pts)

### Components (15 points)
- At least 3 function components. A vast majority, outside of perhaps a title/heading, should be rendered in an 'app `div`' as we have demonstrated in class (5 pts)
- Proper component composition and reuse (5 pts)
- Clean, well-structured component code (5 pts)

### Functionality (10 points)
- Create: Add new items to state (3 pts)
- Read: Display items from state (3 pts)
- Delete: Remove items from state (3 pts)
- Working event handlers (1 pt)

## Design & User Experience (10 points)
- Effective use of Tailwind CSS (5 pts)
- Clean, intuitive interface (3 pts)
- Consistent styling throughout (2 pts)

## Deployment & Documentation (10 points)
- Successfully deployed to Netlify (3 pts)
- Quality commit history with meaningful messages (7 pts)

## Reflection Document (5 points)
Write a brief (1-2 page) reflection covering:
- Your development process
- How you used AI tools (and why)
- Challenges faced and how you overcame them
- What you learned
- What you would do differently next time

## Dataset Options
1. You may utilize any datasets from any previous **Node assigment.** In other words, anythingt that we haven't already rendered in the browser. You could copy/paste data and maybe some of the components from before to get started.
   
2. Or, create your own dataset (must have at least 4 properties per item). You may want to use AI to help with this part.

## Submission Guidelines
1. GitHub repository URL
2. Netlify deployment URL
3. Reflection document (MD)
4. Brief video demo (2-3 minutes) showing key features

## Due Date
End of finals, next Monday, December 9. This is a strict due date. There will be no leeway this time, as opposed to previous homeworks, and pushes to your repo will be blocked after the cutoff date. There must be ample time for proper scoring before final grades are due.

## Grading Rubric Details

## Tips for Success
- Start with state management implementation
- Build and test components one at a time
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Test thoroughly before deployment
- Use AI tools thoughtfully and document their use

## Important Notes
- This is an individual project, but you can certainly peruse your classmates' codes for inspiration. However, each project must be unique.
- You may use AI tools, but must document their use
- All code must be original or properly attributed
- Regular commits are expected to show progress
